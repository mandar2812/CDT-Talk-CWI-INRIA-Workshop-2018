Slides: until 14, perfect.
Toy examples, perfect. 

Discussion on the loss.
===============================
Scalability wrt dimension of X:
* need to increase the size/ number of layers.
* decrease the learning rate. 
* If you are using RELU

dimension of X: 8, dimension of the layers 15-20
dimension of X 32; two layers 30-40.

More data: 

Target domain (solar image, convolutional + PCA): 500. 

Next: toy problem dimension 500. We don't need specialized hardware. 

===================================
Mandar has the code ready for stacking the different channels. 
Architecture:
* convolutional for the images (different channels)
* past solar wind (history); 
Questions:
* having the right features;
* having the right architecture
* having enough data
